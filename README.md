# Personal Website

This is the **second iteration** of my personal website â€” a portfolio built with modern web tech to showcase my projects, skills, and personality. It's a work-in-progress, evolving as I grow as an engineer. The **first iteration** can be found [here](https://github.com/basicallycommits/basically-website). That version was built with React and Vite. It looked fine, but I was unhappy with it and wanted to think bigger. Instead of forking of continuing the old repo, I started from scratch to reflect a new stack (Next.js) and a cleaner approach to design and structure. The old project taught me a lot, but this one is meant to be more polished, scalable, and future-ready.

**Live Site**: WIP. The old one can be found here: [basically-website](https://basically-website.vercel.app/)
